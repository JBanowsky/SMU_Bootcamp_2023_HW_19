# SMU_Bootcamp_2023_HW_19
Module_19 Crypto Clustering
by John Banowsky

This activity is the SMU Boot Camp Module 19 Challenge.
All code was resourced from the SMU Boot Camp Class.

Files:
crypto_market_data.csv
Crypto_Clustering.ipynb

Programs used:
Jupyter Notebook
GitHub

Objective: Use unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

Using a standard scaler function, I normalized the given CSV file.
I then used the KMeans function and inertia values to identify the optimal k-value as well as displaying elbow curves and scatter plots of the clusters.

This was followed by a comparison with the same observations using Principal Component analysis.
